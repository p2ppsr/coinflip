  Coinflip is an example application that combines Project Babbage's identity and transaction systems with <a href='https://scrypt.io/'>sCrypt's</a> smart contracts.
</p>

<h1>How it works:</h1>

<p>
  A user enters another user's MetaNet identity into the search bar, an amount to bet, and whether they would like to choose heads or tails.
  <br/><br/>
  After submitting the challenge, the recipient receives a notification, and may choose to accept or deny.
  If accepted, satoshis will be collected from both users, and the total is awarded to the winner, based on random number generation.
  <br/><br/>
  While this is a simple example, it demonstrates the capacity for establishing digital contracts between two parties using
  decentralized currency. Future applications may include stock options, delivery of goods and services,
  and employment contracts, among others.
